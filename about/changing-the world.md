# Changing the World

I have changed the world three times.

Not everyone can say that. So let me justify thi statement.

## First Change

My first trip to China was in 1978, mainland China was still running trains with steam engines and could barely take care of itself. By 1990 China was beginning to be the industrial powerhouse of the world.

In 1980 all writing, calculating and drawing in China was done on paper. By 1990 the China was the world's largest producer of computers.

The driver was computer software. Most of the software was copied illegally. The most copied software programs were Lotus 123, WordStar, AutoCAD and dBase.

In the early eighties, I was one of the first three dealers of AutoCAD in Asia in Hong Kong. The two others were in Japan and Singapore. The first year we were gangbusters. The the Chinese discovered that computers were lik TVs. The box costs money but you can get the programs for free. My partners were happy selling the hardware. Me, being an architect and daily AutoCAD user ws devastated. I went to work for Apple Computer in Hong Kong for over a year trying to get CAD on a Mac going in Asia-without success. Then Autodesk, the maker of AutoCAD, asked me to be their consultant. My life was changed forever. I was invited to China, Taiwan, Singapore and Korea to demo users and CEOs that you can design a factory on your computer and when the factory is built you can design the products it manufactures.

Hundreds, sometimes thousands of people would come to see me give a demo, pick my brains and challenge me. My favorite was the "I bet you can't..." question. The questions could be about planting rice fields, laying out the tread of a tire in 3D, or designing a factory that made shoes. I never lost a bet. Somehow a light bulb in my brain would go off and I would say, "I bet I can." And I did.

Most every user I met was a pirate user -a sinner. And me working for Autodesk was like being a bishop. My nickname in the region was "Dr ACAD" - short for Doctor AutoCAD. Asia was changing. And, heh, heh, I gave it my blessing.

Putting it another way. I was an influencer - decades before there were influencers.

Of course, China was going to bootstrap itself. And I feel I was part of the boot.

## Second Change

I think it was in 1988, I was at Autodesk HQ in Sausalito, California because of the annual sales conference. The VP of International Sales said "why don't say hello to the US sales people." I said, "I don't know them." He said, "You will."

I went over to their office and chatted. They were intrigued. "How do you sell to the Chinese?" they asked. "Well, let me give a demo", I responded. Um, they were dumbfounded. They told the VP that I must present my demo to the American dealers. The conference started at 9am the next day. The VP said "We'll give you the stage at 8am." To make a long story short, by 9am the the auditorium was full and I received a standing ovation. It turns out that if you can sell to the Chinese you can sell to anyone.

To make an even longer story even shorter, In 1991 I move my family to America and the mission was to design AutoCAD. My colleague Jerry Ford (still with Auotodesk) designed three releases of AutoCAD Along with the forst Release of AutoCAD LT.

In the early 1990s most every architect and engineer in the world was drawing on paper, By 2000 most every architect and engineer in the world was drawing on a computer. And most of them were using AutoCAD. A program I helped design, build and ship.

## Third Change

From the early 2000s to 2010 I was sort of lost. I lost my shirt as an angel investor, I tried to help talented artists build web sites of interest but they could not even remember their passwords, I joined the board of advisors of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection but the other advisors were boring old people.

So, I decided to change the world again or something. Interactive 3D in your browser was the shtick. After deep due diligence I decided the Three.js was it. In 2012 i rote a long email to the developer group extolling the virtues if Three.js in comparisobn to the oter libaries available at the time. After that, once again a I was building demos-my aultimate joy. To this day, Three.js, The JavaScript library that simplifies creating 3D web apps is n everbody list of the bet JavaScript libraries.

I have changed the world three times. Not by myself but with the help of hundreds,millions.

I am a lucky. I care. I dream.

What's next? I don't know. But I am ready.
